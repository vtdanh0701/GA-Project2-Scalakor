# GA Project 2 - Scalakor
In this project I'm making an app that let user pick a chord and display all the useful information about that chord (arp,scale can go well with ...)

## Motivation 
I always find my self and my piano student trouble looking for the right scale to improvise over a chord, so I made this app to help us. 

## Tech/Framework Used
VexFlow !!  
Node   
Express   
Javascript  
Sequelize

## API reference 
https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow.git

## Issues 
Flash() and auth route doesn't work properly  
Small database right now

## Next plan 
Add more chords,scale and licks to database 
Fix the authentication    
Add some styling    
Give the user the ability to input note ( maybe through musicXml)
